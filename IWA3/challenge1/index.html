<!--  
    Why does the code not work?
    - script tag spelt incorrectly as "scripts".
    - script tag not closed properly and the src path should be ./scripts.js.
    - script must be of type "module" for imports to work.
    - script tag works without "defer" property but it is recommended practice.
